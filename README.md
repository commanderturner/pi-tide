# pi-tide

Project to fetch and display high tide info onto a sh1106 display on a pi zero w, based on [luma.oled.device](https://luma-oled.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

currently shows from a json data sheet
have the source as pdf, need to get more data in

## todos

- get more data in (google sheet save as csv, use convert to json add-on in vscode)
- run on startup automatically as service without mac triggering
- have a button to go forward by day
- have a button to go back by day
- then have a button to go to todays date
- expose the sunrise/sunset data if we want
- could add weather on a display toggle button if we wanted
